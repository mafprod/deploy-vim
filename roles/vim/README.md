deploy-vim
=========

A deployer that installs vim and some indicated packages and configures it.
After installing the requirements, it will install some vim-plugins and
configure vim in a usable way.

This way we can enjoy vim the same way on all systems and keep the plugins up
to date by periodicaly re-running the playbook. Also we can then deploy new
plugins or configuration options if we want to add them later.
